# Car_Price_Prediction
This project studies a linear regression model to predict the car prices for the market, in order to help a new entrant understanding important pricing factors/variables in the automobile industry.
I have applied to a highly comprehensive analysis with all data cleaning, exploration, visualization, feature selection and model building. 
The data used for the prediction were collected from Kaggle, written in Python/Jupyter programming language. 
According to a problem-solving approach, I have split it to parts (Data understanding and exploration, Data cleaning, Data preparation: Feature Engineering and Scaling, Feature Selection using Model Building and Linear Regression Assumptions Validation and Outlier Removal).
